Hello Reader, 

My name is Sourav [*@dokaniasourav*], and I recently graduated
from Texas A&M University in Computer Engineering!

Some of my faviouriate projects are as follows:
1. Making a home-automation system using ESP32 and the corresponding Web Framework
2. Perceptron based cache prefetching filtering
3. Line Integral Convolution on Digital Images using WebGL


In my spare time I like to play Table Tennis, Badminton and go 
for swimming at times. My faviourite coding languages are C, C++ and 
Javascript but also really like Python.

One thing I want the most is to travel to diffrent countries with
someone. I also like to learn new languages (currently learning 普通话
and want to next learn Japanese or Korean).

Would like to update this as I go, so stay tuned!
