Howdy fellow reader,

I am Sourav Dokania[*@dokaniasourav*], a recent graduate from Texas A&M University
with MS in Computer Engineering!

Some favourite projects that I did in the past are as follows:
1. I made a home-automation system using ESP32 and a custom made switching triac circuit,
along with its corresponding website and backend. Checkout some of that code here: 
2. Perceptron based cache prefetching filtering
3. Line Integral Convolution on Digital Images using WebGL

In my spare time I like to play Table Tennis, Badminton and go 
for swimming at times. My faviourite coding languages are C, C++ and 
Javascript but also really like Python

Would like to update this as I go, so stay tuned!
